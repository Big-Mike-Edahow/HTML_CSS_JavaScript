            <h2 id="html">HTML</h2>
            <p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the most basic building block of the Web. It defines the meaning and
                structure of web content. Other technologies besides HTML are generally used to describe a web page's
                appearance/presentation (CSS) or functionality/behavior (JavaScript).</p>
            <p>"Hypertext" refers to links that connect web pages to one another, either within a single website or
                between websites. Links are a fundamental aspect of the Web. By uploading content to the Internet and
                linking it to pages created by other people, you become an active participant in the World Wide Web.</p>
            <p>HTML uses "markup" to annotate text, images, and other content for display in a Web browser.</p>

            <h2 id="css">CSS</h2>
            <p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a document
                written
                in HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML). CSS describes how elements should
                be
                rendered on screen, on paper, in speech, or on other media.</p>
            <p>CSS is among the core languages of the open web and is standardized across Web browsers according to W3C
                specifications. Previously, the development of various parts of CSS specification was done
                synchronously,
                which allowed the versioning of the latest recommendations. You might have heard about CSS1, CSS2.1, or
                even
                CSS3. There will never be a CSS3 or a CSS4; rather, everything is now CSS without a version number.</p>
            <p>After CSS 2.1, the scope of the specification increased significantly and the progress on different CSS
                modules started to differ so much, that it became more effective to develop and release recommendations
                separately per module. Instead of versioning the CSS specification, W3C now periodically takes a
                snapshot of
                the latest stable state of the CSS specification and individual modules progress. CSS modules now have
                version numbers, or levels, such as CSS Color Module Level 5.</p>

            <h2 id="js">JavaScript</h2>
            <p>JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight, interpreted, or just-in-time compiled programming language with
                first-class functions. While it is most well-known as the scripting language for Web pages, many
                non-browser environments also use it, such as Node.js, Apache CouchDB and Adobe Acrobat. JavaScript is a
                prototype-based, multi-paradigm, single-threaded, dynamic language, supporting object-oriented,
                imperative, and declarative (e.g. functional programming) styles.</p>
            <p>JavaScript's dynamic capabilities include runtime object construction, variable parameter lists, function
                variables, dynamic script creation (via eval), object introspection (via for...in and Object utilities),
                and source-code recovery (JavaScript functions store their source text and can be retrieved through
                toString()).</p>
