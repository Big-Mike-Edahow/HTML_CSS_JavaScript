                But there is an evil serpent; a Viper that tempts you to take a bite out of the
                asphalt. With a tasty 500-hp V10 powering a mere 3,300-lb roadster, the Dodge
                Viper SRT-10 tricks you into playing music with the loud pedal.</p>

                <p>This car is too excessive, too epic for most people to use on a daily basis.

                need only two seats  this is the car that will shame those who come up against them.</p>
