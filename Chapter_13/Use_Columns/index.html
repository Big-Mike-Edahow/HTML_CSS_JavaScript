				<h1>The CSS Reporter</h1>
				<br>
				<p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the
					presentation of a document written in a markup language. Although most often used
					to set the visual style of web pages and user interfaces written in HTML and XHTML,
					the language can be applied to any XML document, including plain XML, SVG and XUL,
					and is applicable to rendering in speech, or on other media.</p><br>
				<h1>The Future Web</h1>
				<br>
				<p>Heard of XHTML? The W3C produced a specification to combine the vocabulary of HTML
					with the syntax of the eXtensible Markup Language (XML) - but this wasn't popular.
					According to the creator of the World Wide Web, Tim Berners-Lee, "The attempt to get
					the world to switch to XML, including quotes around attribute values and slashes in
					empty tags and namespaces all at once didn't work." The Living Standard for web
					content is HTML!</p>
