        <p>The Statue of Liberty was built over nine years
        <br>by French sculptor Auguste Bartholdi.
        <br>Upon its completion in 1884 all 350 individual pieces
        <br>of the statue were packed into 214 crates for the long
        <br>boat ride from France to New York.</p>
        <hr>
        <p>The statue arrived in America several months later,
        <br>and was reconstruted on Liberty Island.
        <br>Auguste Bartholdi thought that the New York harbor
        <br>was the perfect setting for his masterpiece because it was
        <br>where immigrants got their first view of the New World.</p>
