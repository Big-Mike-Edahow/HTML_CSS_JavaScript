    <p><strong>HTML5 in easy steps, 2nd edition</strong> contains examples and screenshots that illustrate each
        feature of HTML5, describing how to incorporate meta information about a document within its 'head' section and
        how to add structured 'body' content. You'll learn how to create web pages to display text, images, lists,
        tables, hyperlinks, forms, audio, and video - and also how to write script instructions that draw and animate
        graphics on embedded 'canvas' areas. Each chapter builds your knowledge so by the end of the book you'll have
        gained a sound understanding of HTML5.</p>
